### Use Replacement Calc to calculate the probabilities of picking a certain number of objects without replacement, such as picking marbles or cards

<a href="https://rgbstudios.org/replacement-calc">rgbstudios.org/replacement-calc</a>

### Parameters

Enter the following inputs:

- Total number of items (N)

- Number of distinct items (m)

- Number of items picked (n)

- Number of distinct items picked (k)

Then:

- Click "Calculate" and view the probability of exactly k distinct items picked, as well as the cumulative probability of less or more successes

- View the odds of less, than, equal to, or greater than k distinct items picked as a pie chart and bar graph

- Exactly that many is in blue, less than is in red, greater is in green

### Uses

- Studying statistics

- Drew too many or too few lands or energy in a tcg

- Playing games with a standard 52 or 54 card poker deck

### Formulas:

When picking n items out of N total items, where m of them are distinct, the odds of picking <i>exactly</i> k distinct items is defined as:

- P(X = k) = <sub>m</sub>C<sub>k</sub> * <sub>N-m</sub>C<sub>n-k</sub> / <sub>N</sub>C<sub>n</sub>

Where <sub>n</sub>C<sub>x</sub> ("n choose x") is defined as

- <sub>n</sub>C<sub>x</sub> = n! / [ x! (n - x)! ]
